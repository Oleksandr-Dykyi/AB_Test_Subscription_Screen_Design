## A/B_Test_Subscription_Screen_Design

#### Project Description:
In this project, I conducted an A/B test to evaluate an alternative subscription screen design in our mobile application.
Currently, users are presented with a $4.99 weekly subscription offer for premium features, with a 16% conversion rate.
In the test, we introduced a new design that presented the same subscription at a perceived 50% discount.

With about 2,000 daily installs and a 38% user reach rate for the subscription screen, I carefully formulated the hypothesis, noted confidence levels, and identified potential risks.
I selected target and auxiliary metrics and determined statistical significance.
I also specified the test's duration and conditions for success, along with a contingency plan if the test yielded unfavorable results.

After gathering test results, I conducted data analysis, utilizing statistical criteria like Student's t-test and the Chi-square test to assess the null hypothesis.
I calculated p-values, constructed visualizations comparing group means, and created graphs to monitor conversion changes over time.
The project culminated in a comprehensive analysis and conclusions regarding the A/B test's outcomes.
